                    <td>The durian is a fruit that has over hundreds of different named varities. Names as the "King of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour and thorny exterior. Depending on its region, ripeness and other factors, durians can be sour, bitter or creamy and sweet. Personally, I love the creamy sweet kind, and I believe that most foreigners that dislike durian are put off by its strong odour, and chose the bitter/sour kind that most people do not like.</td>
